**Predicting Life Insurance Purchase Using Logistic Regression**
This project uses Logistic Regression, a fundamental classification algorithm in machine learning, to predict whether a person is likely to buy life insurance based on their age.
It is a simple yet effective demonstration of how machine learning can model real-world business scenarios such as customer targeting, risk prediction, and marketing analytics.

**Project Objective**
The main objective of this project is to:
Use a dataset containing Age and Purchased (0/1) values
Build a Logistic Regression model
Predict whether a person will purchase life insurance
Visualize the relationship between Age and Purchase probability
Evaluate the model's accuracy

**Dataset Description**
The dataset contains the following columns:
Column Name	Description
Age	Age of the customer
Purchased	Target variable (1 = Purchased, 0 = Not Purchased)
This is a very common and simple classification dataset ideal for beginners.

**Machine Learning Approach**
1. Data Loading
Load data using Pandas.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
Checking dataset distribution
Visualizing Age vs Purchased
3. Train-Test Split
Split dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Logistic Regression Model
Train a logistic regression classifier using scikit-learn.
5. Predictions & Evaluation
Predict on test data
Evaluate accuracy
Plot Logistic Regression Curve
Visualize prediction boundaries

**Technologies Used**
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn

**Visualization Examples**
The project includes: Scatter plot of Age vs Purchased
**Model Evaluation Metrics**
Accuracy Score

**Conclusion**
This project demonstrates how a simple logistic regression model can effectively predict whether a customer will buy a life insurance policy based on age. It shows the power of data-driven decision-making in the insurance industry and provides a strong foundation for more complex models.
